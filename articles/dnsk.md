# DNSK

Existing for over 15 years now, a lover of electronic music with a penchant for designing and using analogue modular synthesisers and enjoying an eclectic range of music. Influenced by everyone from The Prodigy to Jeff Mills, as waxcide, I make music for minds needing Techno, House, Acid, Minimal, Dub Techno, Progressive Trance/House/Techno and more besides - and also sometimes beat tapes for rap/hiphop lovers or, any others who like chill downtempo breaks. I also occasionally make DJ mixes but mostly just for fun. I have shared my music with everyone and have made all my releases, of any sort, available for free.
