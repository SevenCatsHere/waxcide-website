# waxcide
Existing for over 15 years now, a lover of electronic music with a penchant for designing and using analogue modular synthesisers and enjoying an eclectic range of music. Influenced by everyone from The Prodigy to Jeff Mills, as waxcide, I make music for minds needing Techno, House, Acid, Minimal, Dub Techno, Progressive Trance/House/Techno and more besides - and also sometimes beat tapes for rap/hiphop lovers or, any others who like chill downtempo breaks. I also occasionally make DJ mixes but mostly just for fun. I have shared my music with everyone and have made all my releases, of any sort, [available for free](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCNg6SZwISD8V272M6Jj1KhX0MDtarWJi).

## Waxcide's Live Techno Modular Synth Rig
I have completed the construction of a live techno rig - two boxes of modular synth gear that have everything needed to allow me to perform a full 1-2hr live set of real time produced techno. I have the rig in a working state, although it won’t be the ideal setup I’d like to have - unfortunately there’s two modules I’d like to perfect it, both to be made by Erica Synths, the Erica Synths Black Sequencer and the Erica Synths Black Resonant Equaliser, neither of which is yet available for purchase - I must wait patiently to achieve my perfect setup, c’mon Erica, stop torturing me! in the mean time I'm achieveing the sequencing using a tiptop audio trigger riot and z8000 - those drive a pair of Erica Synths Sample Drums which are be loaded with loops and samples from my Ableton based techno tunes, and these are then combined with the range of Hexinverter Mutant Drums also sequenced by TipTop Trig Riots and a Z8k - all run through a set of mixing and dynamics modules, the core of which is a WMD Performance Mixer. Those modules all fit nicely into two beautiful custom Lamond flight cases that allow me to bring my whole live show to anywhere that can be reached by me with two hands and two feet whether it be down the street or an international flight to the far side of the planet. Since the whole world is in lockdown due to the virus i'm learning this new instrument at home and am planning some webcasts via youtube etc. - keep your eyes peeled for further info on when those will start happening!
