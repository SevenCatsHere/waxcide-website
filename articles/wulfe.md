# Thomas Wulfe

As Thomas Wulfe I have been making a wide variety of original music &ndash; Ambient, IDM, Chillout, Electronica, Breakbeat, Techno, Minimal House, Progressive Trance, Trip-Hop, DnB and more for near 25 years. Influenced by artists such as Orbital, Underworld, BT and Richard D. James, I love any form of electronic music creation means, including using both hardware and software synthesisers, sampling, computers and especially analogue  modular synths. All my Thomas Wulfe music is Creative Commons/Copyme/open source. Fundamentally I'm just someone who likes making beautiful noises for free.

I have started creating what I hope will become a kind of musical installation art piece - I wanted to create music that had no human input involved whatsoever, to see if an entire world of music could be generated from something as simple as just one slow drifting voltage in a machine…

***

This type of music creation is called generative music, and this will be a machine that can create melodies, harmonies, chord progressions, baselines and percussion parts all sounding pleasant to the ear and recognisable as music but completely ‘random’ as far as the origin is concerned.

The music will include repeated but slowly evolving loops and phrases as well as some breakdowns/solos and other recognisable musical landscape features. It will generate these via introducing chaos, random, fractal and other functions that introduce complexity - things that may at first appear to be devoid of musicality but in this case will allow patterns and hooks to appear.

The various voice, timbres and ‘instruments’ will be in tune/key with each other and likewise, rhythms in sync, even sharing grooves and quantising - all to the end of producing identifiable complete musical pieces that could be believed to have come from a human composer.

There is the option of including input from external sensors such as sunlight levels or atmospheric humidity or the impulses transmitted through a plant etc.; although there is the possibility of human interaction such as passers by triggering changes in the music, this might be considered influence of humans and hence making the machine no longer devoid of human input. These external inputs could affect tempo, key, scale tuning, degree of shuffle/groove, timbre and volume or even number of voices in play.

If it proves to sound as good as I hope I plan to get it on display in some gallery/arts type places and maybe eventually tour it round the country&hellip;
