## Interview

<dl class="interview">
	<dt>What first got you into music?</dt>
	<dd>My love for the music goes back so far that I can't even tell you what got me into it. I was too young to remember but I can promise you it had something to do with one of my parents and a very loud radio.</dd>
	<dt>What inspired you to make music?</dt>
	<dd>A Punk kid in a town with 600 people in it made me feel so oppressed as a teenager and I would listen to all these punk rockers talk about how theyre stuck in Suburbia surrounded by conformists and I felt that very very much so I decided I was going to be one of them one day.</dd>
	<dt>What is your creative process like?</dt>
	<dd>I'm not really sure to be honest. Something will come to me in a moment of great emotion, like a phrase or a rhyme and my emotional mind will latch on to it and say use this and create. I never really have a plan or decide I'm going to write today it just comes to me when I have to do it.</dd>
	<dt>If you could open a show for any artist who would it be?</dt>
	<dd>My actual dream is to find my punk rocker voice again start a new band and travel as an opening act for Brodie Dalle and Veruca Salt.</dd>
	<dt>What is one message you would give your fans?</dd>
	<dd>Anybody can write. Everyone can write. Get a notebook write every thought that you have into that notebook and when it's full go back highlight everything that you feel is Meaningful or sounds good. what has a good flow? Keep filling notebooks like that as often as you can and one day you'll be able to harness something close to what you feel is good. Once you have something close to what you feels good show somebody. There's a very good chance that what you have is more than close to good because we are our worst critics.</dd>
	<dt>Do you sing in the shower? What songs do you sing?</dt>
	<dd>I am a lover of rap and boom bap. Gangster rap. In the shower I tend to break out the Wu-Tang Clan and Young Jeezy, 2 Chainz, Sha Mula. So I suppose I don't sing in the shower but I do rap my little heart out.</dd>
	<dt>How do you feel the internet has impacted music?</dt>
	<dd>It used to be that the internet's had to ruin the music industry because people had pirated. These days with SoundCloud and Spotify it's different. Anybody with the drive can make a SoundCloud. Anyone with the dedication can get their song on Spotify. It may have diluted the industry but given the small artists a voice and something to be proud of. Anyone can get noticed at any time you don't have to necessarily know people or be in a place where exposure is more common you just have to get yourself out there and push your music on every platform that you can. You don't even necessarily have to be signed to a big label or move away from your home. Look at artists like Spose and Sha Mula. They have several successful albums, they still live in their home turf oh, they're not necessarily really well-known but they are successful and well loved by their fans. They came up making their tracks themselves with their friends and in their success they got to stay true to themselves.</dd>
	<dt>What do you enjoy the most about being an artist?</dt>
	<dd>When somebody comes to me and says " I really feel a connection to this piece" or " I've been there before exactly" because it means that something that I had created in a time of extreme sadness or great emotion of some sort has been shared with someone who understands. I may have been alone in the moment that I felt it but I'm not alone anymore and neither are they.</dd>
	<dt>If we were to look at the artists that you listen to right now who would be on your playlist?</dt>
	<dd>A lot of Ouija Macc (whoop whoop), Jarren Benton, Ski Mask the Slump God, Lil Darkie, LAW, Eyedea, Big Pun, Biggie Smalls, That 1 Guy, Sublime, Harley Poe, Pat The Bunny, Spose, Sha Mula, The Dicks, Dead Kennedys, Bad Brains, Excision, Subtronics, Childish Gambino, Lil Johnnie, Radiohead, The Tragically Hip, Bush, Watsky, I could go for hours and I'd still just be naming artists I listened to yesterday.</dd>
	<dt>Have you ever dealt with performance anxiety?</dt>
	<dd>Literally every single time I show something to somebody I get anxious about it. I still don't feel like a real writer or artist it all. I feel like I'm riding the coattails of the people around me. But I'm told many feel that way so I just push forward and fake confidence.</dd>
	<dt>How did you come up with your name?</dt>
	<dd>It's actually the name of one of my favourite lipstick colours. I felt that it suited my personality fairly well considering when I'm feeling a negative mood I tend to bring people around me into that negative mood so it's almost like my Gloom is magnetic.</dd>
	<dt>Is there a hidden meaning to your work?</dt>
	<dd>In the early days yeah. I was writing apocalypse poetry and it was most definitely covering up the emotions I was feeling inside but one day I decided I was just going to write what I thought not mask it at all and that's what we have today.</dd>
